# Micopi

Micopi is a now abandoned android programming game. Feautres an unqiue text editor UI.  The game can be desctribed as Cards Against Humanity for programmers. The project was almost done when parse.com announced they were closing down. The app relied on parse for it's backend and a rewrite would take a long time. Feel free to contact me if you have any interest in taking over the project.
